RiotShield also has a Debug Mode for test servers, also this mode has many options to log, ban or not ban, send discord logs for possible ban on "real" server.
Also you can just "Debug-Log", turn a function to on, set "onlydebuglog" for this options and players will not get banned. Instead of a ban you will only get Informations of a possible Ban.

This mode is also outstanding for configuring the right settings of many options to avoid banning players while configuring your anticheat.
